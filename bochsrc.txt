# Memory Detection in Emulators
# When you tell an emulator how much memory you want emulated, the concept is a little 
# "fuzzy" because of the emulated missing bits of RAM below 1M. If you tell an emulator to 
# emulate 32M, does that mean your address space definitely goes from 0 to 32M -1, with 
# missing bits? Not necessarily. The emulator might assume that you mean 32M of contiguous 
# memory above 1M, so it might end at 33M -1. Or it might assume that you mean 32M of 
# total usable RAM, going from 0 to 32M + 384K -1. So don't be surprised if you see a 
# "detected memory size" that does not exactly match your expectations.
