Declare a multiboot header that marks the program as a kernel. These are magic
values that are documented in the multiboot standard. The bootloader will
search for this signature in the first 8 KiB of the kernel file, aligned at a
32-bit boundary. The signature is in its own section so the header can be
forced to be within the first 8 KiB of the kernel file.

The multiboot standard does not define the value of the stack pointer register
(esp) and it is up to the kernel to provide a stack. This allocates room for a
small stack by creating a symbol at the bottom of it, then allocating 16384
bytes for it, and finally creating a symbol at the top. The stack grows
downwards on x86. The stack is in its own section so it can be marked nobits,
which means the kernel file is smaller because it does not contain an
uninitialized stack. The stack on x86 must be 16-byte aligned according to the
System V ABI standard and de-facto extensions. The compiler will assume the
stack is properly aligned and failure to align the stack will result in
undefined behavior.

	and any code it provides as part of itself. There's no printf

	safeguards, no debugging mechanisms, only what the kernel provides
	itself. It has absolute and complete power over the

	   Mind that you might later enable interrupts and return from
	   kernel_main (which is sort of nonsensical to do).
	2) Wait for the next interrupt to arrive with hlt (halt instruction).
	   Since they are disabled, this will lock up the computer.
	3) Jump to the hlt instruction if it ever wakes up due to a
