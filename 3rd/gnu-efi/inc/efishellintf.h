  SHELL_INTERFACE_PROTOCOL from EDK shell (no spec).

  Shell Interface - additional information (over image_info) provided
  to an application started by the shell.

  ConIo provides a file-style interface to the console.

  The shell interface's and data (including ConIo) are only valid during
  the applications Entry Point.  Once the application returns from it's
  entry point the data is freed by the invoking shell.
